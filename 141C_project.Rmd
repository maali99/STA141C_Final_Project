## Introduction
We decided to run logistic regression on our dataset. Model selection was dictated by bootstrapping the data and averaging out the resulting p-values of each model to decide which variables were most significant in order to retain them for the best model. 


```{r}
data <- read.table("adult.data")

# null logistic model
nullModel = glm(data$V15 ~ 1, family = binomial(), data = data)

#best logistic model derived from bootstrapping data
model = glm(data$V15)

```

## Analysis of odds
According to the model, 
```{r}

```
